Santa VitÃ³ria,Bike lanes,85,"To calculate the score for the action of implementing bike lanes in Santa Vitória based on the provided rules, we will evaluate it according to the criteria set forth:

1. **Cost**: The cost of the bike lanes is $1,000,000.
   - Since the budget is $10,000,000, this is a low cost action relative to the budget. Score contributes positively.

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action reduces 100,000 kg CO2eq emissions.
   - Given total emissions are 250,000 kg CO2eq, a reduction of 100,000 kg is a significant percentage (40%). Score contributes positively.

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action is stated to reduce risk and the city has a high risk level.
   - Reducing risk is important, especially for a high-risk city. Score contributes positively.

4. **Matches Environment**: The action matches the coastal environment.
   - Bike lanes are suitable for coastal cities, encouraging alternative transportation. Score contributes positively.

5. **Matches Population**: The action is beneficial for the population of 100,000.
   - More bike lanes can help improve urban transport for a larger population. Score contributes positively.

6. **Time**: Implementation time is 1 (presumably in months or years).
   - A shorter implementation time is favored. Score contributes positively.

Given those criteria, I would assign a score based on the degree to which each rule is satisfied. Here's an estimated breakdown of the score:

- Cost (low cost action): 10/10
- GHG emissions reduction (40%): 8/10
- Risk reduction: 10/10
- Matches environment: 10/10
- Matches population: 10/10
- Time (short implementation) : 10/10

Adding these scores gives: 10 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58

However, since scores should be normalized to a 0-100 scale and we want to incorporate that this is an overall positive action:

Final score: **[85]**"
Novo Horizonte,Flood Barriers,80,"To evaluate the action ""Flood Barriers"" for the city of Novo Horizonte based on the given rules, let's break down the action against the criteria.

1. **Cost**: The cost of the action is 15,000,000. This is lower than the budget of 125,000,000, so it meets the financial viability.
   - Score: 20 points (higher score for lower cost)

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action results in a GHG emissions reduction of 0. This is not favorable as it does not contribute to emissions reductions.
   - Score: 0 points (no emissions reduction)

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action provides high risk reduction, which is beneficial for the city facing medium risk.
   - Score: 20 points (high risk reduction is prioritized)

4. **Environment Compatibility**: The action is suitable for coastal environments but Novo Horizonte has a jungle environment. Therefore, it does not match the environment.
   - Score: 0 points (does not match the environment)

5. **Population Fit**: The action matches the city population size of 1,000,000, which is advantageous.
   - Score: 20 points (matches the population)

6. **Time Efficiency**: The action takes 10 time units. Without a comparison or understanding of other available actions' time frames, it's challenging to evaluate its efficiency, but considering it doesn't appear to be immediately effective, we will assess a lower score.
   - Score: 10 points (moderate score for time taken)

Now, combining all the scores:
- Cost: 20
- GHG Emissions Reduction: 0
- Risk Reduction: 20
- Environmental Matching: 0
- Population Matching: 20
- Time Efficiency: 10

Total Score = 20 + 0 + 20 + 0 + 20 + 10 = 80 points.

Thus, based on the evaluation, the score for the action ""Flood Barriers"" in the context of Novo Horizonte is:

Novo Horizonte,Urban Tree Planting,60,"To evaluate the Urban Tree Planting action for Novo Horizonte against the provided prioritization rules, we will assign weights to each criterion:

1. **Cost**: Lower cost actions are better.
   - Cost of action: $3,500,000. The budget is $125,000,000, the cost is reasonable. Score: 80

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: High emissions reductions are better.
   - GHG emissions reduction: 75,000 CO2eq. In relation to total emissions (4,000,000 CO2eq), this is a 1.875% reduction. Score: 70

3. **Risk Reduction**: High risk reduction is better.
   - Risk reduction: Medium. This does not particularly reduce risk significantly but does provide some benefit. Score: 60

4. **Environment Match**: Actions that match the environment are better.
   - Environment of action: Urban vs. environment of city: Jungle. This is a mismatch, so score lower. Score: 40

5. **Population Match**: Actions that match the population are better.
   - Population of action: 800,000 vs. population of city: 1,000,000. This is a mismatch as well, but not extremely far off. Score: 50

6. **Time**: Actions that take less time are better.
   - Time required: 5 years. This is a medium timeframe but not too long. Score: 60 

Now we calculate the total score by averaging the individual scores:

Novo Horizonte,Bike lanes,55,"To prioritize the action of implementing bike lanes in Novo Horizonte, we will evaluate it based on the provided rules:

1. **Cost**: The action costs $1,000,000. Given the budget of $125,000,000, this is a relatively low-cost action. (Score: 10)
  
2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action results in a reduction of 100,000 CO2eq. Compared to the total GHG emissions of 4,000,000 CO2eq, this represents a moderate reduction in emissions. (Score: 5)

3. **Risk Reduction**: The provided action has a positive implication for risk reduction. Since the risk is rated as medium, any risk reduction is beneficial. (Score: 10)

4. **Matching the Environment**: Implementing bike lanes aligns well with a jungle environment, promoting sustainable transport. (Score: 10)

5. **Matching the Population**: The action encourages health and mobility for the population of 1,000,000. It matches the population’s needs effectively. (Score: 10)

6. **Time**: The action’s implementation time is rated as 1, indicating it can be executed quickly. (Score: 10)

Now, I will calculate a total score, assigning equal weight to each category (max score for each category is 10):

- Cost: 10
- GHG Emissions Reduction: 5
- Risk Reduction: 10
- Environment: 10
- Population: 10
- Time: 10

Total Score = (Cost + GHG Emissions Reduction + Risk Reduction + Environment + Population + Time) = 10 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 55

Since the maximum possible total score could be 60 (10 points per category for 6 categories) and recognizing that 55 is quite strong overall given the various categories:

The final score is [55]."
Novo Horizonte,Sea wall,50,"To prioritize the action of building a sea wall for Novo Horizonte based on the provided rules, we will assess the action against each criterion:

1. **Cost**: The cost of the action is 10,000,000. Since the budget is 125,000,000, this is considered a lower cost action and scores well. 
   - *Score: 20 (out of 20)*

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action results in 0 GHG emissions reductions, which is the least favorable outcome possible according to the criteria.
   - *Score: 0 (out of 20)*

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action is rated as high risk reduction, which is very favorable.
   - *Score: 20 (out of 20)*

4. **Environment Match**: The action is coastal, while Novo Horizonte's environment is jungle. This does not match well and scores poorly.
   - *Score: 0 (out of 20)*

5. **Population Match**: The action does not explicitly match the population characteristics (though we can assume it would provide some community benefits), but it’s not targeted specifically for the population of Novo Horizonte.
   - *Score: 5 (out of 20)*

6. **Time**: The action would take 5 years, which is considered a longer duration and scores lower.
   - *Score: 5 (out of 20)*

Now, compiling the scores together:
- Cost: 20
- GHG Emissions Reduction: 0
- Risk Reduction: 20
- Environment Match: 0
- Population Match: 5

Santa VitÃ³ria,Urban Tree Planting,48,"To evaluate the action of Urban Tree Planting for Santa Vitória, we will follow the prioritization rules given:

1. **Cost**: The cost of the action is 3,500,000, which is feasible within the budget of 10,000,000. This scores well since it's within budget but is significantly lower than the maximum possible score, considering the cost.

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action provides a reduction of 75,000 CO2eq, which is a notable amount relative to the total emissions (250,000 CO2eq). This can be scored reasonably high.

3. **Risk Reduction**: The risk reduction is medium. Given that Santa Vitória has a high risk level, medium risk reduction does not score as well as high risk reduction would.

4. **Match Environment**: The action matches an urban environment, which is relevant; however, the city is coastal and has its own characteristics, lowering this score slightly.

5. **Match Population**: The action targets a population of 800,000, which is larger than Santa Vitória's population of 100,000. This does not align well, leading to a lower score.

6. **Time**: The time required for implementation is 5 years. Longer timelines may detract from effectiveness, as shorter time frames are preferred.

Now, we can assign a score based on the aforementioned criteria. 

Example scoring could be:

- **Cost**: Score around 70 (affordable)
- **GHG Emissions Reduction**: Score around 65 (meaningful reduction but not the highest possible)
- **Risk Reduction**: Score around 40 (medium level)
- **Match Environment**: Score around 50 (fits urban but not perfectly)
- **Match Population**: Score around 30 (misaligns with city size)
- **Time**: Score around 40 (5 years is a moderate timeframe)

We can average these scores:

(70 + 65 + 40 + 50 + 30 + 40) / 6 = 48.33

Rounding would lead to a final score of 48.

Thus, the overall score for Urban Tree Planting in Santa Vitória is:

Santa VitÃ³ria,Solar Panels,45,"To evaluate the Solar Panels action for Santa Vitória, we'll consider each of the prioritization criteria.

1. **Cost**: The cost of the action ($7,000,000) is 70% of the city's budget ($10,000,000), which makes it relatively high considering the lower cost is preferred. Subtracting points for high cost has a negative impact. 

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action provides a reduction of 200,000 CO2eq, which is significant considering the city's total GHG emissions of 250,000 CO2eq. This also earns high points.

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action provides low risk reduction, which means this aspect scores low as higher risk reductions are favored.

4. **Environment Match**: The environment of Santa Vitória is coastal, while the action has a mixed environment match, which is slightly less favorable. 

5. **Population Match**: The population of Santa Vitória is 100,000, while the action's population is targeting 1,200,000. It’s not matching well with the local population.

6. **Time**: The time for implementation is 10 years, which is comparatively long, thus losing points in this category.

Now we can assess a score based on these criteria:

- Cost: 30 (as 0 to 100 scale could imply high impact reduces score dramatically).
- GHG Emissions Reduction: 90 (high reduction, significant impact).
- Risk Reduction: 20 (low risk reduction).
- Environment Match: 60 (partial match).
- Population Match: 20 (poor match with the local population).
- Time: 30 (long implementation time).

To calculate the total score, we average the individual scores:

Novo Horizonte,Electric Bus Fleet,45,"To prioritize the action of implementing an Electric Bus Fleet for the city of Novo Horizonte, let's analyze it according to the provided rules:

1. **Cost**: The cost of the action is $12,000,000, which is lower than the budget of $125,000,000. This is a positive factor.
   - Score: 10/10
   
2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action provides a reduction of 300,000 CO2eq, which is a significant contribution relative to total emissions of 4,000,000 CO2eq.
   - Score: 7/10 (300,000 reduction out of 4,000,000)

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action has low risk reduction, which is a negative factor since higher risk reduction is better.
   - Score: 2/10
   
4. **Environmental Match**: The action matches an urban environment, but Novo Horizonte is a jungle environment. This is not ideal.
   - Score: 3/10
   
5. **Population Match**: The action is designed for a population of 1,500,000, larger than Novo Horizonte's population of 1,000,000. This is a mismatch.
   - Score: 2/10
   
6. **Time**: The time required for implementation is 8 units, which is fairly long.

Santa VitÃ³ria,Green Roofs,43,"To evaluate the action of implementing Green Roofs in Santa Vitória using the provided prioritization rules, we can break down the evaluation as follows:

1. **Cost**: The cost of the action ($2,000,000) is lower than the budget ($10,000,000), so it meets the budget requirement. However, considering lower-cost actions are prioritized higher, we'll note that this is not a low-cost action.

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action leads to a reduction of 50,000 CO2eq. It is a substantial reduction, but we need to compare it to the total GHG emissions (250,000 CO2eq). While this is a meaningful reduction, it is not the highest achievable reduction compared to different strategies.

3. **Risk Reduction**: The risk reduction from implementing Green Roofs is categorized as low. Given that the city faces high risks, this is not favorable.

4. **Environmental Match**: The action matches the urban environment but not the coastal environment of Santa Vitória. This could be a disadvantage since actions that align with the local environmental context are preferred.

5. **Population Match**: The action is termed for a population of 500,000, which exceeds Santa Vitória’s population of 100,000. Actions that are tailored to the local population are deemed better; thus, this does not match well.

6. **Timeframe**: The time to implement is given as 3 (units not specified, but assuming this means months/years). Without other actions to compare, a time of 3 might be manageable, but it still takes time which is less favored compared to actions that can be implemented more swiftly.

Now, we can evaluate based on these criteria, assigning rough scores based on the rules:

- Cost: 50/100 (because it’s on the higher side)
- GHG Emissions Reduction: 60/100 (moderate reduction)
- Risk Reduction: 30/100 (low reduction is unfavorable)
- Environmental Match: 40/100 (urban match but not coastal)
- Population Match: 30/100 (not suited for local demographics)
- Time: 50/100 (not the quickest)

Final Calculation of Average Score:
(50 + 60 + 30 + 40 + 30 + 50) / 6 = 43.33

1. **Cost**: The action costs $5,000,000, which is 50% of the budget ($10,000,000). Lower cost actions are prioritized, so it scores moderately. 

   - Score: 60 (out of 100 for cost)

2. **GHG Emissions Reductions**: The action provides zero emissions reduction (0 CO2eq), which is the least favorable outcome. 

   - Score: 0 (out of 100 for emissions reduction)

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action has high risk reduction, which is beneficial.

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action provides a substantial reduction of 300,000 CO2eq. Since the city's total GHG emissions are 250,000 CO2eq, this action offers a reduction greater than the current emissions level, which is a major positive. (Score: 100)

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action has low risk reduction. For a city with high risk, this is insufficient and negatively impacts the score. (Score: 0)

4. **Environment Match**: The action’s environment is Urban, while Santa Vitória has a coastal environment. This is a mismatch and negatively influences the score. (Score: 0)

5. **Population Match**: The action is designed for a much larger population (1,500,000) than that of Santa Vitória (100,000). This is not a good match. (Score: 0)

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The solar panel action reduces GHG emissions by 200,000 CO2eq. While this is a positive contribution, the total GHG emissions for the city are 4,000,000 CO2eq, so the reduction is only 5%. This is a moderate level of emissions reduction.

3. **Risk Reduction**: This action has a low risk reduction, which is not ideal according to the prioritization rules. 

4. **Environmental Matching**: The action is categorized as Mixed, while the environment of Novo Horizonte is predominantly jungle. This means it does not fully align with the local environment.

5. **Population Matching**: The action is suitable for a larger population (1,200,000) than what Novo Horizonte has (1,000,000). This is a mismatch, although not significant.

6. **Time**: The action takes 10 years, which is a longer duration and not favorable in terms of prioritization.

Santa VitÃ³ria,Sea wall,15,"To prioritize the action based on the rules provided, we can analyze the action ""Sea wall"" against the criteria:

1. **Cost**: The action cost is 10,000,000. Given that the budget is also 10,000,000, this action utilizes the entire budget. However, since we need to prioritize lower costs, achieving maximum budget allocation may negatively impact its score. (Weight: moderate)

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action does not provide any GHG emissions reduction (0 CO2eq). This is a significant drawback, as high emissions reductions are favored. (Weight: high negative impact)

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action has a high risk reduction. This positively contributes to its score. (Weight: strong positive contribution)

4. **Matching Environment**: The action matches the coastal environment of Santa Vitória, which is beneficial. (Weight: moderate positive contribution)

5. **Matching Population**: The action does not specify how it directly benefits the population, so it may be considered neutral. (Weight: neutral)

6. **Time**: The action takes 5 years to complete. While this is not the longest time frame, faster actions are preferred in the prioritization. (Weight: moderate negative impact)

Now, let's assign scores to each criterion, considering the weights:

- Cost: -10 (full budget use)
- GHG Emissions Reduction: -30 (zero emissions reduction)
- Risk Reduction: +30 (high risk reduction)
- Matching Environment: +10 (matches coastal environment)

2. **GHG emissions reductions**: The action does not contribute to GHG emissions reductions (0 reduction), which is a significant negative factor.
3. **Risk reduction**: The action provides high risk reduction, which is a positive factor.
4. **Matching the environment**: The action is suitable for a coastal environment, which is a positive factor.
5. **Matching the population**: The action does not match the population size since the action is designed for a larger population (1,000,000), which is a negative factor.
6. **Time**: The time required for this action is 10 (presumably months or years), which is a longer duration compared to quicker actions, leading to negative scoring.

Novo Horizonte,Green Roofs,0,"To prioritize the action of implementing green roofs in Novo Horizonte, we will evaluate it based on the provided rules:

1. **Cost**: The action costs 2,000,000. Given the city budget of 125,000,000, this is a lower-cost action (but not the lowest), allowing for potential consideration.

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action reduces GHG emissions by 50,000 CO2eq. In the context of the city’s total GHG emissions of 4,000,000 CO2eq, this is a relatively low reduction. 

3. **Risk Reduction**: The action has low risk reduction. Since the city is facing a medium risk, this factor is not favorable.

4. **Environment Alignment**: The action aligns poorly with the city's environment as it is categorized as 'Urban', whereas Novo Horizonte has a jungle environment. This dissonance negatively impacts the priority.

5. **Population Match**: The action is targeted at a population of 500,000, which is less than the city population of 1,000,000. This means it does not adequately match the population, affecting its viability.

6. **Time**: The implementation time is 3 years. Given the city must consider time-to-impact, this is a moderate timeframe.

2. **GHG Emissions Reduction**: The action has a GHG emissions reduction of 0, which is a significant negative as emissions are not reduced.
3. **Risk Reduction**: The action provides high-risk reduction, which is a positive factor.
4. **Environment Match**: The action matches an Arid environment, while Novo Horizonte has a jungle environment. This presents a negative aspect.
5. **Population Match**: The action targets a population of 400,000, while Novo Horizonte has a much larger population of 1,000,000. This is another negative factor.
6. **Time**: The time required for implementation is 7 units (it is not specified what the unit is, but we interpret this as relatively long). Longer time is a negative aspect.
